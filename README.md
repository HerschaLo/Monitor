# Taskmaster

A work-in-progress chrome extension designed to increase user productivity through incorporating multiple functions such as a pomodoro timer and a website blocker that can either blacklist certain websites or allow you to visit only a select number of sites you’ve whitelisted. In addition to this, it also records your browsing habits, so you can see if you’re spending too much time procrastinating if you want to procrastinate as a way of taking a break every now and then during work. 

P.S. When I couldn't figure out a final name for my extension i called it "Monitor" as a placeholder, hence the name of the repository.
